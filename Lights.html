        <h2 style="font-weight: bold">What we do?</h2>
        <p>As a light tech our job is to make the show look good. We use all sorts of different lights and colours to make people attracted to the show. We also allow the people on stage to be seen by using a simple wash of light. In shows like Big Night In and Out we often get a bunch of moving lights and blinders in to add some effects to the show. Setting up all the lights can take a while, but the result is usually worth it.</p>

        <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Set up</h2>
        <p>Our lighting desk is a Hoglet 4 (as seen in the photo) and is a partially digital desk. Unlike the sound desk, the faders on the lighting desk are not motorised. At school we have a bunch of different lights including but not limited to, two moving lights, a bunch of 2kâ€™s and par cans, and a few LEDs. Most of the lights are plugged into a dimmer rack which allows us to control the brightness of each light. DMX signals allow us to change the colour and for movers the position of the beam.</p>
