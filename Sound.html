        <h2 style="font-weight: bold">What we do?</h2>
        
        <p>As a sound tech our job is to make sure that music, videos, and bands can be heard and sound good. With bands live mixing is often required more than with music and videos. Live mixing is the process of changing the volume and sound of different aspects live. When mixing bands we have to make sure that the music from the instruments doesnâ€™t drown out the singers voice. We either have to make the band quieter or the singer louder.</p>
        
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Set up</h2>
        
        <p>Our sound set up consist of our sound desk and microphones and speakers. Our desk is a Yamaha TF5 (as seen in the photo) and is completely digital. This desk is what we use to mix and monitor sound levels. The signals from the microphones on stage are sent back to the desk and from the desk sent to output at the speakers. The digital desk allows us to have many different microphones and other inputs at the same time. This allows us to have bands and drama skits all with their own microphone.</p>
