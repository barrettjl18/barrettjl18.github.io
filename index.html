         <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">What we do?</h2>
        
        <p>At Christchurch Boys’ High School, the technical crew runs all assembly’s with sound and lighting. We also do all the technical side of the Big Night In and Big Night Out which is the performance of many bands and occasionally drama skits. As the tech crew we rig all the lights and program them to create some pretty cool things. We also set up all the microphones so that the band and singers can be heard.</p>

        <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">How often we do things?</h2>
    
        <p>Most weeks we have two assemblies, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday. For this we set up the necessary microphones and videos required on screen. Assemblies are usually pretty simple. Twice a year we have a big performance of bands know as Big Night In and Big Night Out. These are usually held in the end of term two and the end of term three. As the tech crew we put a lot of time into these events to make sure they look good and go as smoothly as possible.</p>
